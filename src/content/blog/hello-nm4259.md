## About me

Hey there! I'm Lester, a final year CS undergraduate at [NUS](https://nus.edu.sg) with a minor in Interactive Media Development. I particularly enjoy designing and building digital experiences that users love! Some of the things I've designed and built over the past few years can be found on my [personal homepage](https://www.lesterong.com/projects). 


## Hopes for NM4259

Coming into NM4259, I hope to gain a better understanding of designing for interactions in mobile computing. Mobile interactions form the majority of our interactions with modern day programs as the world becomes increasingly mobile. Laptops. Tablets. Smartwatches. Each of these platforms have their own set of constraints, and better understand how to cater to these constraints.
