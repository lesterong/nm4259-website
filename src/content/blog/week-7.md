- Good artists copy, great artists steal
  - This obviously doesn’t mean to copy templates wholesale, but that there is great value in tapping on existing resources. For one, good templates are probably designed based on researched heuristics and adhere to widely adopted design systems (from people who likely know what they are doing, more than me for sure)- which cuts down a lot of work especially for someone without much formal UI/UX experience. This allows us to design more quickly (crucial with the short deadlines), and more importantly, get feedback early, and following which, iterate and improve.
  - Borrowing design elements from existing apps
- Finding value in what’s not there and what's already there
  - Why do users not use a particular feature -- was the button not big enough
  - For example, we might believe that "Feature A" is the perfect solution to "Problem B." But in reality, Problem B might not be as significant as we think, or Feature A might not align with what users actually want or find useful. This disconnect often arises because our perspective is limited to our own experiences and sometimes, perhaps a small, non-representative sample of people around us. My takeaway is that successful design requires us to step outside our own frame of reference and actively engage with the actual needs and expectations of our users, which leads me to the final lesson.
  - Another particularly insightful lesson that was stressed quite a number of times throughout the class is the importance of also paying attention to the missing when conducting user testing, and thinking critically about the why and so.
  - For example, when our user tester missed out on the search and filter button on our events page, it should have triggered some questions in our mind.
  - For instance, why? Was the button not big enough? Were there other more distracting elements on the same screen?
  - And so, does something need to change? Is this a common pattern we see amongst our other test users? Is the search and filter functionality a key action we want our user to focus on anyways in a “normal user flow”?, etc.
  - I realised that forcing myself to think more critically about not just the things that are in plain sight can draw quite some rather useful insights.

While we did not have the opportunity to build multiple wireframes. I felt that my group meetings showed me the iterative nature of design.

- diffeerntiating between software and design features
  - fuzzy search
