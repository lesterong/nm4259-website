This week, we wrapped up our group project. The bulk of the work done this week was on the wireframe and report. My group worked on redesigning NUS NextBus.

## Finding inspiration

One significant pain point we identified was the lack of clear bus occupancy information for users. This prompted me to reflect on how other similar applications were addressing this issue, which led me to suggest competitor analysis to my group. This analysis was invaluable in increasing our understanding on the strengths and weaknesses of existing solutions and guide our decision on what features to incorporate into our redesign.

I examined how other applications displayed bus occupancy information and compared it to NUS NextBus. One application I looked at was SG BusLeh.

In comparison, this is NUS NextBus.

I found BusLeh's bus occupancy information to be significantly more intuitive than NUS NextBus. NUS NextBus, however, seems to neglect this crucial detail on its timing pages. Initially, I mistakenly assumed the color of the bus timings indicated occupancy levels, but they only represent the arrival time. The bus occupancy information was only displayed in the mini-map below.

Upon further reflection, I realised that including this feature was essential for our redesign. Many other bus timing applications I looked at, including BusLeh, SG Buses all had a similar implementation of bus occupancy information. By obscuring occupancy information to another page, the existing application disrupted users' mental model of typical bus timings application. Furthermore, according to our user research, the bus timings page is the most frequently access page. The lack of occupancy information on this page also hinders users' journey planning, making NUS NextBus less user-friendly as a whole.


## Iterative nature of *wireframing*

While we did not have the opportunity to build multiple wireframes. I felt that my group meetings showed me the iterative nature of design.

- diffeerntiating between software and design features
  - fuzzy search

## Closing thoughts

- Design is about users, not you.
  - User testing
  - Never assume anything
  - Many of us came into this class with assumptions for design.
- Good artists copy, great artists steal
  - This obviously doesn’t mean to copy templates wholesale, but that there is great value in tapping on existing resources. For one, good templates are probably designed based on researched heuristics and adhere to widely adopted design systems (from people who likely know what they are doing, more than me for sure)- which cuts down a lot of work especially for someone without much formal UI/UX experience. This allows us to design more quickly (crucial with the short deadlines), and more importantly, get feedback early, and following which, iterate and improve.
  - Borrowing design elements from existing apps
- Finding value in what’s not there and what's already there
  - Why do users not use a particular feature -- was the button not big enough
  - For example, we might believe that "Feature A" is the perfect solution to "Problem B." But in reality, Problem B might not be as significant as we think, or Feature A might not align with what users actually want or find useful. This disconnect often arises because our perspective is limited to our own experiences and sometimes, perhaps a small, non-representative sample of people around us. My takeaway is that successful design requires us to step outside our own frame of reference and actively engage with the actual needs and expectations of our users, which leads me to the final lesson.
  - Another particularly insightful lesson that was stressed quite a number of times throughout the class is the importance of also paying attention to the missing when conducting user testing, and thinking critically about the why and so.
  - For example, when our user tester missed out on the search and filter button on our events page, it should have triggered some questions in our mind.
  - For instance, why? Was the button not big enough? Were there other more distracting elements on the same screen?
  - And so, does something need to change? Is this a common pattern we see amongst our other test users? Is the search and filter functionality a key action we want our user to focus on anyways in a “normal user flow”?, etc.
  - I realised that forcing myself to think more critically about not just the things that are in plain sight can draw quite some rather useful insights.
